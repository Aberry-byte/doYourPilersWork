# What is this project

This project is a way to test the following compilers, transpilers, and interpreters

- Python 3+
- C
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Rust
- Golang
- Lua
- Ruby

# How do I use it?

Two dependencies are *needed*.
- make
- python3

If you gave have these you can use either

####  github command line
    gh repo clone Aberry-byte/doYourPilersWork
####  just git
    git clone https://github.com/Aberry-byte/doYourPilersWork.git

Then you can move into the created directory and run `make`

# TODO

## General wants
- Print out piler version as well
- I want to have little dependencies as possible so anyway to facilitate that I am open to, this might require switching to a compiled language for the main script.
- add option to install all available pilers (probably too much for this project)
